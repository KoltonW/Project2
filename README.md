This repo is a host for reports for Monday to Sunday.  

I used the following code to automate the reports.
`DayofWeek<-unique(Data$weekday)
render_one<-function(weekday){
  rmarkdown::render(
    "Project2.Rmd",output_file = paste0(weekday,".md"), params = list(weekday=weekday)
  )
}

for (weekday in DayofWeek){
  render_one(weekday)
}`
